# Remote Command Execution over TCP and UDP (IPv6)

This project implements a client-server system to execute Unix commands remotely using IPv6 over TCP and UDP protocols. The server executes the specified command multiple times with a defined delay and sends both the execution time and command output back to the client. The client displays these results and terminates once all executions are completed.
